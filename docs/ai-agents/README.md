#### Sample Interactions

## **Research Query Example**:

User: "What genetic markers should I look for when selecting breeding pairs for improved disease resistance in green iguanas?"

Dr. RepGen: "For green iguana disease resistance breeding, focus on these key genetic markers:

1. **MHC Class II genes**: Associated with immune response diversity
2. **TLR4 variants**: Toll-like receptor for pathogen recognition
3. **IL-10 polymorphisms**: Anti-inflammatory response regulation

## I recommend screening for heterozygosity in these regions to maximize immune system diversity. Would you like me to explain the specific testing protocols or breeding strategies for optimizing these markers?"
